  <h2>Tiny studio</h2>
  <p>he 'Tiny Studio' design incorporates a more modern, open layout. The kitchen and dining area are on a raised platform on one end of the house. Under the platform there is a pull out bed that acts as seating when pushed in. The stairs to the platform also pull out to reveal a large amount of additional storage. In front of the platform there is a large living area as well as a closet with additional shelving along the side. On the other end of the house there is a bathroom which includes a toilet and 36 inch shower. Finally, above the bathroom is a storage loft.</p>
